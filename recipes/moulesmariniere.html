    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.75kg/4lb mussels</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>15g/½oz butter</li>
        <li>a bouquet garni of parsley, thyme and bay leaves</li>
        <li>100ml/3½fl oz dry white wine or cider</li>
        <li>120ml/4fl oz double cream</li>
        <li>handful of parsley leaves, coarsley choppe</li>
        <li>crusty bread, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the mussels under plenty of cold, running water. Discard any open ones that won't close when lightly squeezed.</li>
        <li>Pull out the tough, fibrous beards protruding from between the tightly closed shells and then knock off any barnacles with a large knife. Give the mussels another quick rinse to remove any little pieces of shell.</li>
        <li>Soften the garlic and shallots in the butter with the bouquet garni, in a large pan big enough to take all the mussels - it should only be half full</li>    
        <li>Add the mussels and wine or cider, turn up the heat, then cover and steam them open in their own juices for 3-4 minutes. Give the pan a good shake every now and then.</li>
        <li>Remove the bouquet garni, add the cream and chopped parsley and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Spoon into four large warmed bowls and serve with lots of crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
